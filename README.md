# Beginner React useState Project

A tiny React app (Vite) that demonstrates the `useState` hook with two features:
1) **Counter** — increase / decrease / reset.
2) **Input Tracker** — mirrors what you type in real time.

## How to run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Recording script (quick)
- Intro (name & project).
- Show Counter: click +, -, Reset; explain `useState` state update.
- Show Input Tracker: type text and show live rendering.
- Wrap up and mention repo link.
